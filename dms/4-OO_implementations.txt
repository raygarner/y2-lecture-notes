aggregation
    the object is part of the class but is passed in as a parameter and set using a setter normally. the member object can exist on its own outside of the class
    compound=-animal
        the animal can be added to and taken from the compound

Composition
    the object is instantiated and initialised inside the class and cannot exist outside of the class
    zoo=-compound
        the compound cannot be taken from the zoo

inheritance
    creating a new class based on an existing one
    superclass (parent) extended
    subclass (child) extension
    "Is a" relationship:
        falcon (subclass) is a bird (superclass)
        
method overloading
    methods with the same name in the same class but with different parameters (different method signature)
    resolved during compile time

method overriding
    method with same name declared in subclass and superclass
    resolved during runtime

overloading and overriding are both examples of POLYMORPHISM

java interface class
    methods cannot have implementations
    any declared variables must be final (constant)

java abstract class
    can have some abstract (empty) methods
    can have non-final variables

a class can only ever extend one other class but they can implement many interfaces
