protocols
    protocol = set of signatures to which a class responds
    specific signatures for methods

contract
    set of responsibilities

responsibility
    set of public methods

method names
    verbs

signature
    arguments and their types for a method

functions should have true/false return types by default (not void)
    return true if completes correctly
    return false if doesnt complete correctly

default settings make a massive practical difference
    eg whether the default is to print double sided or not

class documentation
    name and abstract/concrete ID
    immediate parents and children
    reference to location in hierarchy and collaboration graphs
    description
    collaborations
    responsibilities for each collaboration defined in this class
    list signatures for each of the responsibilities added for collaborations
    dont worry about listing private responsibilities
    implementation notes

subsystem documentation
    name
    classes
    references to hierarchy and collab graph locations
    description
    contracts supported by the subsystem
    list which class/subsystem is dealing which each contract
