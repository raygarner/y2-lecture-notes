collection
    object that represents a group of objects
    collections api is used for representing and manipulating any collection
    something that holds a dynamic collection of objects

api = application programming interface

library
    re-usable chunks of code

API
    INTERFACE/communication protocol between a client and server to simplify the development of client-side software

Java collections framework core principles:
    container objects containing objects
    each container is either a collection or map
    all containers provide a common set of methods signatures plus their unique set of method signatures
    provides data structures such as arrays, lists and maps
    provides algorithms such as searching and sorting

map
    defines mapping between keys and objects (between two collections)

iterable
    collections can return an iterator object which can scan over each object in a collection

collection framework interfaces
    iterable
    collection (group of objects (elements))
    map
    queue
    dequeue (double ended queue)
    set
    list

most interfaces are in java.util.*

interable interface in java.lang.*

typesafe collections via generics
    ie LinkedList<String>
    the type cannot be a primitive like 'int'
        'Integer' class would be used instead in this case
