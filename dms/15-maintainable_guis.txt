MVC (model view controller)
    controller: keyboard, mouse etc
    view: GUI/TUI/CLI, screen, speakers etc
    model: computer software interpreting inputs from the controllers
    mvc uses observer pattern: 
        view entities (UI) can subscribe to state change notifications (can be caused by input from the controllers)
        the model notifies the subscribed views when a model's state changes

FXML = FX Markup Language
    used to describe the layout of a GUI
    separates the interface design and the main code
    interface design <---> FXML <---> main code
