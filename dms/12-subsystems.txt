initial design
    classes 
    responsibilities
    collaborations

second stage
    analyse hierarchies
    identify contracts

subsystem
    group of classes that collaborate to support a set of contracts (closely related responsibilities) 

coupling
    how much classes depend on each other

subsystems are meant to simplify interactions
