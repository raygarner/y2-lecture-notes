scrum is an agile framework

lightweight, iterative and incremental framework

scrum recognizes that customers will change their minds about what they want/need and that there will be unpredictable challenges

scrum accepts that the problem cannot be fully defined in advance

RIDAs = risks, impediments, dependencies and assumptions

product backlog
    breakdown of work to be done
    ordered list of product requirements
    user stories, use case diagrams
    features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements

product owner
    defines product in customer-centric terms (user stories etc)
    priorities aspects of the project
    interface between the engineers and the stakeholders
        define and announce releases
        communicate delivery and team status
        share progress during meetings
        share RIDAs with stakeholders
        negotiate priorities, scope, funding and schedule
        ensure that project backlog is visible, transparent and clear

scrum master
    coaching the team with scrum principles    
    promoting self-organisation within the team
    organising team evens to ensure regular progress

sprint
    unit of development
    length of a spring is defined in advance for each sprint and is normally about 2 weeks
    sprint planning
        define goal and required backlog items
    sprint review/retrospective
        reviews progress from the sprint to show to stakeholders
        identify improvements which could be applied to future sprints
    useful output should be created from each sprint
        eg integrated, tested and documented software

sprint planning
    define scope of sprint
    select backlog items to be completed in one sprint
    create sprint backlog (work to be completed this sprint)
    agree on sprint goal (what is the deliverable at the end of this sprint)
    4 hours sprint planning for a 2 week sprint is recommended
    
daily scrum
    every day meeting during a sprint
    only developers should contribute
    what did i complete yesterday that contributed to the team meeting our sprint goal?
    what do i plan to complete today to contribute to the team meeting our sprint goal?
    do i see any impediment that could prevent me or the team from meeting our sprint goal?

sprint review
    reviews work
    plans work that wasnt completed
    demos the completed work to the stakeholders
    collabs with stakeholders on what to work on next
    DO NOT demo incomplete work
    2 hours for a 2 week sprint (recommended)

sprint retrospective
    reflects on past sprint
    IDs continuous process improvement actions
    what went well?
    what went poorly?
    what could bee improved for next sprint?
