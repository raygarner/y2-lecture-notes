subculture of agile development community

eliminate waste
amplify learning
decide as late as possible
deliver as fast as possible
empower the team
build integrity in
optimize the whole

anything not adding value to the customer is considered waste:
    partially done work
    extra features
    relearning
    task switching
    waiting handoffs
    defects
    management activities

    building the wrong feature/product
    mismanaging the backlog
    rework
    unnecessarily complex solutions
    extraneous cognitive load
    psychological distress
    waiting/multitasking
    knowledge loss
    ineffective comms
