variables:
    H - high priority task
    M - medium priority task
    L - low priority tasks
    R - shared resource

L is running and is holding R
H cannot pre-empt L because it needs R to run
M does not need R so it pre-empts L (note L is still holding R)
M is running and H cannot pre-empt it because it needs R to run and L is still holding R
