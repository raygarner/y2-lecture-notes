race condition
    consumer removed last element
    producer adds new element
    consumer should have gone to sleep but no longer will
    consumer consumes non-existing elements

consumer producer concept works by storing the value of counter 'items'

you can have n consumers, m producers and buffer size N
    sync - enforces mutual exclusion for the buffer
    empty - keeps track of the amount of empty buffers (initialised to N)
    full - keeps track of the number of full buffers (initialised to 0)
    empty and full are counting semaphores and represent resources
