cloud computing
    out source computation and storage to a data centre
    +no worries about power, cooling or maintenance of machines (host handles that)
    data centres use virtualisation to isolate clients on a single physical machine
    +data and services accessible from anywhere at anytime

data centre
    located where electricity is cheap and internet is good

cloud computing caveats
    host reliability
    where is the data stored
    data security

rapid elasticity
    key challenge in cloud computing
    easily increase/decrease resources allocated to each client
    to the client, resources should appear unlimited
        pay as you go style system for the client

virtualisation
    if a server needs shutting down, the VMs need to be migrated to a different server
    non-live migration:
        pause the VM and save a checkpoint
        copy over memory pages to new hardware as fast as possible
    live migration
    move the VM while it is still operational

Service models
    infrastructure as a service (IAAS)
    platform as a service (PAAS)
    software as a service (SAAS)
    desktop as a service (DAAD) (new service)

LAAS
    provides underlying resources to client
    eg a VM

PAAS
    tools for software development mainly (IDE, compiler etc)

SAAS
    an application like gmail, microsoft 365, dropbox, onedrive

cloud deployment models
    private
        implemented within internal IT set up of a company
    public
        organisation selling cloud services to the public
    community
        somewhere between private and public (multiple companies pool money together and share their IT departments)
    hybrid
        some public servers, some private servers
