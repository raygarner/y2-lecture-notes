power law: n^k
exponential: b^n

Theoretical analysis:
    uses a high level description of the algorithm instead of a proper implementation that can be executed by a computer
    ie pseudocode

primitive operations
    basic computations done in an algorithm eg:
        storing data in a variable
        comparing 2 numbers
        adding two numbers
        calling/returning a function
        indexing an array
        fetching a variable from memory
    assumed to take a constant and consistent amount of time to execute
    independent from programming language
    close relation to asm instructions

Random access machine (RAM) model
    generally 1 cpu
    generally unlimited bank of memory cells, each of which can hold a number or character
    memory cells are numbered
    accessing a memory cell takes a fixed amount of time
