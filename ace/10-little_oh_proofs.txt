little oh multiplication:
    let
    f(n) is o(g(n))
    h(n) > 0
    then
    h(n) * f(n) is o(h(n) * g(n))

multiplying big oh by little oh:
    let
    f1(n) is O(g1(n))
    f2(n) is o(g2(n))
    then
    f1(n) * f2(n) is O(g1(n) * g2(n))

big oh family may be used in context as sets:
    o(1) = {f(n) | f(n) is o(1) (and f(n) > 0)}
