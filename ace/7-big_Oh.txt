f(n) is O(n)
but practically it is
f(n) is O(1)

f is O(g) can be written like: f O g

reflexive:  x R x

symmetric: x R y <-> y R x

transitive: x R y && y R z -> x R z

Big-Oh is reflexive

Big-Oh is not symmetric

Big-Oh is transitive

O(n) can be thought of as a set of functions containing all functions that satisfy 'f is O(n)'

n^O(1) means 'n to the power of a function which is a member of the set O(1)
