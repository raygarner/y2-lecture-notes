to prove implication, assume the left side

use 'assume' for negation too, because negation is just P -> false

use 'constructor' for \and to split it into 2 goals

use 'left' or 'right' for \or to reduce the goal to one side

use 'constructor' to prove true because it is just an empty \and
use 'cases' to prove fase because it is an empty \or

conjunction = and
disjunction = or

em - excluded middle
